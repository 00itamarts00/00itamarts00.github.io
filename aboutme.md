## Interests & Hobbies  

Beyond AI, I have a strong interest in **motorcycles, technology, and optimization problems** (inside and outside of machine learning). When Iâ€™m not working on AI projects, youâ€™ll find me:  

- **Riding my Honda CB500X**, because solving problems sometimes requires a fresh perspective (and open roads).  
- **Fixing everything I can**, from electronics to home repairsâ€”if itâ€™s broken, Iâ€™ll try to fix it.  
- **Pottery making**, shaping both clay and ideas with my hands.  
- **Trying to learn guitar for years**, but still far from playing a full song.
